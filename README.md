# SNLP-final-project

Find appropriate subwords for a given corpus.
Train a neural network model over these subwords.
Use the trained model to generate a newer, larger "corpus".
Compare the OOV rates obtained on varying sizes of the generated corpora with a baseline OOV rate over word tokens.
Perform hyperparameter tuning at subword and neural network level to get the optimal OOV rates over the generated corpora.
