1.Find appropriate subwords for a given corpus.
2.Train a neural network model over these subwords.
3.Use the trained model to generate a newer, larger "corpus".
4.Compare the OOV rates obtained on varying sizes of the generated corpora with a baseline OOV rate over word tokens.
5.Perform hyperparameter tuning at subword and neural network level to get the optimal OOV rates over the generated corpora.
